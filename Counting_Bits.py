# Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

class Solution:
    def countBits(self, num: int) -> List[int]:
        li=[]
        for i in range(0, num+1):
            a=bin(i)
            count=a.count('1') 
            li.append(count)
        return li
